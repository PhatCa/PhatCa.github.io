# Love Hate Relationship
My love of software engineering traces back to my childhood when video games and movies like The Matrix and The Social Network sparked an early interest in this digital realm. As I grew up, the thrill of problem-solving in software engineering drew me in. The rewarding feeling of overcoming challenges and successfully navigating the complexities of software development solidified my passion for this field.

## What about the hate?
As much as it sounds,  the landscape of software engineering has undergone significant shifts, particularly the 2023 mass layoffs, which have shifted the entire job market. This made job searching harder than ever. Many big tech companies have fired thousands of people, for example, google fired someone who worked for their company for 20 years!

## What should I do?
Despite the challenge, my goal is to keep my head up the water and continue to hone my coding skills. Learning new stack and adapting the use of AI is one of the must in my opinion. Hopefully by the time I graduate the job market could have some improvement and not be as competitive as it is right now.
