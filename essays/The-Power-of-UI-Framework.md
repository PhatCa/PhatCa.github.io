## What is Bootstrap 5?

Bootstrap is one of the popular front-end frameworks that utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript to help develop responsive websites. However, Bootstrap requires users to understand the basic concepts of CSS, HTML, and Javascript to understand it. So if a user is already familiar with the coding stack for web development why would they consider learning a UI framework like Bootstrap to develop their website?


## What does Bootstrap offer?

UI Frameworks, such as Bootstrap 5, one of the main reasons why people use it is because of how simple it is to use after a user already familiar with the coding stack, the learning challenge in my opinion is not that hard if software developer already familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Another worth mentioning is Bootstrap has one of the greatest documentation and a large community of developers that still working on and improving it over time. Bootstrap helps software developers to developer to get their front end part up with ease of time with features such as responsive where developers can just design from mobile and it takes only a few tweaks to make the website front end look good on a larger screen.

## So what is the drawback of Bootstrap?
In my opinion, Bootstrap is a great UI Framework for front-end development, however, if compared with other frameworks such as Tailwind then we can see that Bootstrap has too much code that is being loaded into HTML and can make the code in an HTML file look a bit messy. Also, users will have to learn multiple class names to be able to implement it efficiently. Another drawback I could see is Bootstrap taking away too much creativity for front-end developers. What I mean by that is a lot of time, users only need to add Bootstrap to the existing interface and format the web page style, and they already have a responsive website that is considered acceptable. With its convenience and ease of use, this is also the reason why users tend to be lazy in creativity. As a result, users will use what is available in Bootstrap to create a website without spending too much time.
