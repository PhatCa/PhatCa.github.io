# I. Introduction

AI or Artificial Intelligence has been bigger than ever in education, especially in Software Engineering. These tools are like having an assistant that helps with simple tasks such as organizing schedules to assist my learning. In my ICS 314 course, AI has been one of my “to-go” tools in searching. It assisted me in planning my time, fixing my writing, and understanding tricky concepts in software development. The main AI tool that I used are ChatGPT and Grammarly to help me with a lot of my learning. In this essay, I will explain how AI made a real difference in my learning journey, especially in Software Engineering, and how it impacted on my studies


# II. Personal Experience with AI:

I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

## 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
For the most part, I made a effort to tackle the WOD tasks without relying on AI. My reasoning was simple: I believed that true learning comes from making mistakes and learning from them firsthand. So, I took the challenges head-on, aiming to grasp the syntax and concepts without external assistance. In the initial stages of the semester, AI tools took a backseat in my learning journey as I prioritized building a solid foundation through independent problem-solving. This approach allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and hone my skills organically.
## 2. In-class Practice WODs
With that same belief in mind, I stuck to practicing WODs and homework independently as much as possible. However, there were moments when I found myself grappling with a problem for an extended period. In such cases, after spending more than thirty minutes trying to figure it out on my own, I turned to ChatGPT for assistance. I compared this choice to seeking assistance with a difficult math problem. Sometimes, a gentle push in the right direction is all you need to identify where you've made a misstep.
## 3. In-class WODs
Through practicing WODs, I developed the ability to complete the in-class WODs of the week independently, without relying on ChatGPT. However, there were instances when time constraints led me to seek assistance from ChatGPT to finish up. Reflecting on this, I realized that resorting to ChatGPT midway through a task was less effective than using it from the outset. This approach required creating a prompt to align its understanding with my code, adding an extra layer of complexity. Nonetheless, I found that the clear instructions provided for the WODs, coupled with the practice I had done, largely sufficed in guiding me through the tasks.
## 4. Essays
I relied on Grammarly for all my essays, finding it very helpful  in rectifying any grammar issues. Typically, I would draft my essay and then apply Grammarly to polish it up, refining the language to ensure clarity and coherence. 
## 5. Final project
For our final project, I heavily relied on ChatGPT to streamline our workflow. I used it to create schedules, outline tasks, and allocate responsibilities to group members based on their proficiency in web development and understanding of front-end and back-end concepts. By providing ChatGPT with prompts about our website's requirements, the necessary pages, and information about my teammates, it effectively assisted me in organizing and prioritizing tasks.
## 6. Learning a concept/tutorial
I used ChatGPT to explain some of the hooks in React when I found them hard to understand even after going through their docs. Having it break down what hook is and the use of them. Moreover, ChatGPT explained the ideal file structure for Meteor projects, empowering me to navigate and organize my code effectively.
## 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I did not use AI in this field since our colleague, TA, and professors in the Discord group are always able to help with other’s questions
## 8. Asking or answering a smart question
I did not use AI in this field. I tend to my problem on my own rather than post in the chat. I choose to go over the docs for most of the time and if I still don't get the problem solved or understand the concept then ChatGPT or Stackoverflow are my next resources.
## 9. Coding example e.g. “Give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
I found ChatGPT efficient in explaining the Underscore library and it was helpful for me to use ChatGPT as a lookup for which function I need in different cases in the practice WODs
## 10. Explaining code
I used ChatGPT to explain the Underscore library and in syntax explanation when I have an error in my code or eslint
## 11. Writing code
I didn’t use ChatGPT to write out any code block without writing it first so the majority of the time I use it to correct my code rather than have it generate a whole code
## 12. Documenting code
When writing my code, I tend to leave a comment as I know it is good practice since it would allow other people to know which code is doing what and I did not use ChatGPT in this field
## 13. Quality assurance 
Typically, I'm satisfied with my coding style and haven't utilized ChatGPT for assistance in this area. However, upon reflection, I believe ChatGPT could be beneficial. It might aid in condensing certain sections of my code into shorter, more concise versions. Exploring alternative methods through ChatGPT's insights could be valuable, providing me with a fresh perspective on different approaches to coding.
## 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
I did not use ChatGPT in ICS 314 other than listed above
## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Using AI tools like ChatGPT and Grammarly has had a big impact on how I learn in ICS 314. While I mainly learn by trying things on my own, ChatGPT has been super helpful when I get stuck on coding problems. It's like having a smart tutor that explains things in a way I can understand. Grammarly has also been great for improving my writing, making it clearer and easier to read. These tools have helped me grasp tricky concepts in software engineering, like React hooks and JavaScript syntax. Plus, they made managing our final project a lot smoother, helping our team work better together. Overall, using AI tools has not only helped me solve problems but also encouraged me to keep learning and improving.

# IV. Practical Applications:
I have noticed that a lot of other companies have tried AI in their software such as Facebook and Meta however, with my knowledge of real-world projects and simulations or collaborative activities then the current AI that I know is not suitable for this task
# V. Challenges and Opportunities:
Figuring out the right way to explain things to ChatGPT can be tough. It's like trying to understand how these AI tools think, which isn't always easy. One idea I have for improving them is letting users upload PDFs or other docs to help the AI learn better. However, there's a risk that people might upload faulty documentation, messing up the AI's learning process. Balancing the benefits of such enhancements with the potential risks would require careful consideration and robust safeguards to ensure the accuracy and reliability of AI-driven solutions.
# VI. Comparative Analysis:
In software engineering education, we have our traditional teaching techniques like lectures and hands-on projects, and then there are the newer AI-enhanced methods. The old-school ways could be boring and dense, but the AI makes learning more fun and engaging since the student will constantly come up with their question for the AI. Additionally, AI methods use smart algorithms to tailor lessons to how students learn best, which helps students remember the material better. And when it comes to learning practical skills like coding, AI tools give students real-time help and feedback, making it easier to learn by doing. So, while both ways have their perks, mixing traditional teaching with AI tools seems like the best bet for learning software engineering.
# VII. Future Considerations:
I would say AI will change the way people learn but one of the future considerations I could come up with is that the university can come up with one great AI that is dedicated to teaching and able to answer problems for students. It would work as a 24/7 tutor for students when working on their homework/project and aid the student learning process while the professor still able to control the amount of information to give

# VIII. Conclusion:
In summary, AI emerges as a standout tool for students seeking to enhance their understanding of class material. These freely available resources offer invaluable support and provide students more power than ever. By mastering the art of harnessing AI tools effectively, students can unlock a wealth of knowledge and accelerate their learning process. Thus, embracing AI in education represents a strategic approach to maximizing learning outcomes and academic success.
