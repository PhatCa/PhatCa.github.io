## Why is Javascript so popular?

I have gained experience working with JavaScript through some projects, appreciating its structured nature and simplicity in comparison to other programming languages like Java or C.  For example, running a JavaScript application requires a single command in the terminal, whereas in C, multiple commands are necessary to execute the code. In the past years, Javascript has been one of the best programming languages used in the professional field, coupled with popular frameworks such as React, Angular, and NodeJS

In the course of my projects, I have found JavaScript to be particularly versatile. Many open-source projects utilize JSON, which, in my opinion, enhances readability and ease of use. In contrast to the learning curve of languages like C or Java, I found myself grasping JavaScript concepts faster, due to its intuitive nature. The ability to write code directly in the Google Chrome browser is one of the best features. Furthermore, the evolution of JavaScript, with ES6 being the current standard, empowers software developers with enhanced functionality and the principle of keeping code "dry."

Regarding the current class, I find the Workouts of the Day (WODs) enjoyable, as they simulate the intensity of mock interview scenarios for students. The timing and adrenaline rush during these exercises contribute to a positive learning experience. The WODs, resembling puzzle-solving sessions, provide a sense of accomplishment when the solution becomes clear which is a truly rewarding moment.
