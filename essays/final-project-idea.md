# Happy Hour Finding
Team member: Phat Ca, Adam Windfield-Smith, Jason Aguda, Christian Yang

## Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)

1. Problem: Different restaurants and bars have happy hours at different times on different days. It can be hard to keep track of when you can get the cheapest deals on drinks and meals.

2. Website Idea:
Restaurant owners could use our website to publish their restaurant’s happy hour deals.  Happy Hour Finder app would use the current time of the user to get all the valid happy hours in the database based on restaurant input. Our website is designed for local businesses only


## Mockup page ideas

* Admin Page
* Home Page
* Restaurant Owner User Page

## Use case ideas
* Restaurant Owner create their account, able to create and edit their restaurant data and view their data
* Admin can delete anyone data/view
* Regular user can use landing page to see all the active happy hour based on the current time


## Beyond the basics
* Bringing the Local and UH community together to decompress after classes/work and save money
* Bring more customers in to Local businesses and restaurants
