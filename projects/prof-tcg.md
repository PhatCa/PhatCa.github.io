## Overview of Prof CTG
Our project endeavors to merge the excitement of trading card games with the UH Manoa academic community by leveraging Meteor for real-time communication, React for modular UI development, and React Bootstrap for enhanced design. With a focus on facilitating student-to-student card trading, introducing professor-themed card packs, implementing a rarity system, establishing a trading hub, and empowering professors to reward academic excellence, our platform aims to create a dynamic environment where students can build connections with peers and faculty members while engaging in an exciting and gamified academic experience.


## My Contribution
Throughout this project, my primary focus revolved around the backend development, where I meticulously designed and implemented the logic driving the site's functionality. From conceptualizing the architecture to crafting intricate algorithms, I ensured smooth operations and seamless interactions between the frontend and backend. My responsibilities extended to database creation and management, where I engineered robust data structures to support the platform's requirements. Additionally, serving as the project manager on GitHub, I meticulously organized and oversaw the project's progression from milestones such as M1, M2, to M3, ensuring timely execution and alignment with project objectives. Moreover, I took charge of deployment processes, guaranteeing a smooth transition from development to production environments. Furthermore, I played a pivotal role in establishing and enforcing team contracts, fostering a collaborative and efficient working environment conducive to project success.

## My Experience
During this project, I underwent a significant learning journey. I spent most of my time learning Meteor, understanding its functionality and capabilities comprehensively, which broadened my skill set in JavaScript-based development. Moreover, I acquired invaluable knowledge on deploying applications using Digital Ocean. Exploring tools like Studio 3T enriched my understanding of backend data management, equipping me with the expertise to handle databases and ensure data integrity efficiently. Additionally, my experience as a GitHub manager honed my project management skills, teaching me how to effectively organize workflows, track progress, and facilitate collaboration within a development team. Overall, this project provided me with a multifaceted learning experience, encompassing technical proficiency, project management understanding, and collaboration skills essential for success in software development
